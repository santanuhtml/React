=========================
1. What is React?
=========================
React is a JavaScript Libary for bulding user interface. (user interface => website/app which we are see)
With the React, we build single page application becatuse in React project has single html, means
only one HTML file is delivered to the browser but in this single html file we import all react application

React Allows us to create re-usable and reactive components which contain
HTML+JavaScript+ and CSS.
React is all about "Components"

Vanila JavaScript:
If we using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery
then it is called Vanilla JavaScript.
	--- so it is not a React


=========================
2. What isComponents?
=========================
Component is Reusable building blocks in your user interface.
Simply if we have same item with different data, which is just reapting.
-----------

<div class="thumbnile">
<h1>santnau</h1>
<p>16000</p>
</div>

<div class="thumbnile">
<h1>Prakash</h1>
<p>22000</p>
</div>

-----------
That is exactly what Components are, Reusable building blocks 
in our user interface.

Components are just combination of HTML code and CSS code and 
possibly JavaScript code for some logic.

We can split our User interface in so many Components as our need.

-------------------------
Declarative
-------------------------
React uses something which is calle a Declarative apporoach for
building these components.
