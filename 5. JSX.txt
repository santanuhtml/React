JSX 
JSX stands for JavaScript XML (HTML => XML)
JSX is basically HTML code inside the JavaScript code. 
JSX convert/transform this HTML code in to js code so that it will run in the browser.

For example in Basic JavaScript we need to type:

function App(){
const para = document.createElement('p');
para.textContent = 'Ths is also vidible';
document.getElementById('root').append(para);
}

but in React js

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is also visible</p>
    </div>
  );
}

*** Note:
<div>
   <p>This is also visible</p>
</div>

This above piece of cade looks like a Html code but it is not a html code. It is
JSX Code. so if we plan to add some class the we will add using 'className'
Example:

<div className="text-style">
   <p>This is also visible</p>
</div>
