16. Organizing Component Files

In React js Project there has possible to have lots of Components and
so we can manage those as our need in separated folders. For Example
we can separate UI related component like 'Card' in UI folder.

In this Project We separate All component into two folders
[]UI and []Expenses

We keep 'Card.js' and  'Card.css' in the folder []UI
And other all components in []Expenses

After separate all component as our need we have to also
correct the links.

Here we have to correct 

'Expenses.js'
--------------------
import Card from '../UI/Card';


'ExpenseItem.css'
--------------------
import Card from '../UI/Card'; 


'App.js'
--------------------
import Expenses from './components/Expenses/Expenses';
