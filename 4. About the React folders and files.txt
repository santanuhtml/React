	//Its brings all Mordern JavaScript features like Impot & Export

	function App() {
          return (
            <div>

          );
        }   

        export default App;

   	------------

	Note:
	In App.js file we see a HTML code runs under js code, this was possible using
        a JSX, it is a special syntax intruduced by the React js.
	

public:
   --> index.html
       In React has single html file which is the end loaded by the browser here
